Skillset Management System
Paulette Melchiori

11/25/2024 - initial start of project.

11/26/2024 - initial functional structure of Skillset Management System.
This Python project is a Skillset Management System built with the intention of providing an interface to easily add skills to my portfolio website on the Skillset page. 

The skills that are managed and added to are stored within a PostGreSQL database which are to be consumed by a .NET C# web application, which is the Skillset page itself.

The first round of this project is just the UI and the database connected in. Future enhancements will be coming to make this application look a little nicer.

However, my next plan is to design and implement a .NET C# project which will interact with the same database as this Skillset Management System does. Bye for now!
